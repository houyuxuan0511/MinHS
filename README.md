# MinHS
This is an assignment for course Concept of Programming Language Design in Utrecht University, I only finished first 4 tasks, which contains only 76% of whole assignment and gain only 6.4, which means only 84% (around) accurate. But when I tested with the test cases given by the lecturer, I got more than 96% correct, and it will be higher after modifying the Refunc part, maybe because the last few tests were not completed very well. If you see this document, remember: I am not good at functional programming and I had a very hard time to pass this course. Wish you all the best.
